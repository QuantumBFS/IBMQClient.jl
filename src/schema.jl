The gate config data structure has the following keys.

- `name`: Gate name, as it will be referred to in the OpenQASM circuit.
- `parameters`: List of parameters for the gate (empty if no parameters).
- `coupling_map` (optional): List of qubits that the gate applies to, each element of the list is
an n-qubit list where n is the size of the gate (e.g. 1-qubit gate, 2-qubit gate).
- `qasm_def`: OpenQASM definition of the gate in terms of the basis gates [U,CX].
Each unitary gate has an efficient representation in this basis.
- `conditional` (optional): Gate supports conditional operation (true/false). If not
listed then defaults to the backend setting.
- `latency_map` (optional): List for each gate of length n registers that indicates
if the feedback speed to the register is fast (1) or slow (0). In the above example
the u3 gate for qubit 0 has low latency for conditionals to register 0, but qubits
1 and 2 have low latency to both registers 1 and 2.

    struct DeviceInfo <: IBMQSchema

The backend will have a method Backend.configuration() which returns the required
backend config data structure. Backends can include additional items to this
structure.

- `backend_name`: Unique (to provider) backend identifier name. This could describe
a setup that goes through several changes, but retains common elements (e.g.,
for a physical device backend this could include the same coupling map and the
physical location, etc.)
backend version: Backend version string in the form `"X.X.X"`. Versions could
indicate, e.g., code changes, equipement upgrades, different cooldowns, new optimizations, etc.
- `n_qubits`: Number of qubits in the backend. Simulator backends return `"-1"`.
- `basis_gates`: List of the available gates on the backend as an array of gate names
(these should match the entries in gates).
- `coupling_map`: Representation of the physical coupling map on the device (the
coupling maps for each gate are defined in gates).
- `gates`: List of the available gates on the backend as a gate config data structure, see [`GateInfo`](@ref).
- `local`: Backend runs locally (`true`) or online (`false`).
- `simulator`: Backend is a simulator (`true`) or an experimental device (`false`).
- `conditional`: Backend supports conditional gates (`true`) or does not (`false`).
Individual gates may also support or not support conditionals.
- `configurable`: Backend (if simulator) is configurable (`true`). If true then there
are user specified configuration parameters (e.g., the topology, noise parameters,
etc.). The data structure for these settings is set by the specific backend.
- `n_registers` (required if conditional is `true`): Specifies the number of registers
slots (i.e. the number of register bits) that are available for conditional operations.
Each register can hold a bit value.
- `register_map` (required if conditional is `true`): Specifies the registers that each
qubit can store measurements. For this example, qubits 0 and 1 can store in
registers 0 and 1, qubit 2 in registers 2 and 3, and qubits 3 and 4 in registers 3
and 4.
- `open_pulse`: OpenPulse experiments are accepted on this backend.

The configuration structure may also have the following optional fields,

- `online_date`: Date that the backend was put online.
- `display_name`: Alternate name for the backend that is more descriptive that can
be used for display purposes.
- `sample_name`: Name of the sample for this given backend (likely blank for a
simulator).
- `description`: String to describe the backend.
- `url`: Internet address to the backend (if applicable).
- `tags`: List of tag strings for the backend that indicate true/false properties, e.g.,
`"credits_required"` (backend requires credits to run). Any absent tag means that
the property is false and new tags can be added.
- `quantum_volume`: quantum volume of given device.
- `max_experiments`: maximum experiment.
- `max_shots`: maximum shot can spawn.

as a histogram of counts of the memory states, the memory, or (for simulators) the
statevector or unitary matrix.

- `counts`: Histogram of counts in the different memory states. Only states with
non-zero counts are listed as keys. The states are labeled in hex (e.g., a 4 slot
memory `"1010"` (bit string) is decimal 10 and hex `"0xA"`).

this is a list of hex strings indicating the state for each shot.

of the simulator state to be recorded.

}
```

- `name`: `"snapshot"`.

value of ``n₂`` will increase as more data is taken. For backends that return the data
in sections (e.g. for bandwidth reasons) shots is given as a two-element list where
the data is from shot ``n₁`` to shot ``n₂`` (``s = n₂ − n₁``). The next call will give the
